  description: The gate shuts behind you as you enter the room. It is ominously quiet.
    There is a passage to the east that appears blocked by more of that strange, foul-smelling
    mucous. A pearly-white skeleton hangs from the gooey threads, mangled and contorted.
    The passageway to the west is blocked by a gate.
