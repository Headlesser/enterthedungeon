    is a gargoyle. The statue is ancient and crumbling, but seems harmless. A single
    blue gemstone adornes one of its eye sockets.

  - keyString: west
    exitDescription: To the WEST is a sturdy doorway. There are deep scratch marks
      on the floor leading through it. The stones leading down the passageway appear
      stained with a dark, coagulated substance, and you can faintly make out what
      appears to be the decaying remains of torn fingernails.

  - keyString: east
    exitDescription: To the EAST is a rotting doorway coated with a slimy residue
      that stinks of brine and mildew. You can feel a damp breeze flow from the passageway
      beyond. A low, steady rumble echoes just on the other side.
