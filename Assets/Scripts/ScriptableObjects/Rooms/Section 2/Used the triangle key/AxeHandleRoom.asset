  description: The room appears to be a dead end, though it is cluttered and filled
    to the brim with waste. Piles of bramble, mud, rocks, and other material sit in
    festering piles. A large, uprooted tree takes up most of the space, with dried
    yet sturdy <color="brown">branch</color>es reaching into the air like fingers.
    You also find a <color="lightblue">shovel</color> half-burried under some dirt.
    It looks like it's seen better days.
