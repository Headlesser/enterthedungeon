  description: There is a <color=#008080ff>lonely old tree</color> rooted at the center
    of the crossing. While lacking any sign of fruit, it appears sturdy and thriving.
    You can see that further down the passage to the west the ceiling has caved in.
    You'd better get out of here before the rest of the ceiling goes with it.
