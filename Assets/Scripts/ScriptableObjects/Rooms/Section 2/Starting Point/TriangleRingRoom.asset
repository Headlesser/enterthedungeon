  description: 'You notice a strange condensation begin to form on the walls as you
    enter the room. There is a large, rounded formation protruding from the wall like
    a boil on raised, fleshy skin. It looks like there might be something on the other
    side, but you see no sign of anything to indicate a handle or button to open the
    way beyond a <color="lightblue">circular</color> indentation in the center of
    the door. It looks like something must have been able to fit it at one point in
    time.

    The festering smell is stronger here, but you cannot see anything that would indicate
    a source besides an unsavory, <color="olive">puce</color> colored substance that
    seems to have dripped onto the floor.'
