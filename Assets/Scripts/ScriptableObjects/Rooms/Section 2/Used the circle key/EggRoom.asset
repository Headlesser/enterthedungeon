  description: Immediately you are assaulted with the foul scent of bile and puss.
    Huge towering mounds of dirt and other noxious materials populate the room, rising
    up from every speck of flat foundation available. The mounds are covered from
    tip to base in slightly transparent, jell-filled sacks, each with a small, opaque
    kernel at the center. They appear to move and undulate in waves, like a water
    balloon ready to burst. You find more of the unnamed, <color="olive">puce</color>
    colored substance leaking from the granuels covering the mounds. It seems that
    the <color="orange">heated air</color> is stimulating its production.
