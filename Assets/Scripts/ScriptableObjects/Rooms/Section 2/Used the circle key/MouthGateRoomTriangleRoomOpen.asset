  description: As you enter the room, a torrent of steamy, humid air washes over you,
    making your skin feel damp and sticky. Burning torches line the walls and you
    find another large gate blocking your path forward. The bars do not appear to
    be made of metal, and you notice the ground right in front of it is stained a
    bright red. You could almost swear you saw the bars moving...
