  description: 'The air is much drier on this side of the dungeon. It appears there
    once was a lot of traffic here, but when and by whom, you are not sure. The walls
    are lined with heavy iron <color="lightblue">ring</color>s, some of which are
    still fitted with old, rusted chains. The faint stench of iron and salt hangs
    in the air.

    There is an oddly shaped door to the EAST that is blocked by the same unidentified
    material as the main gate. There is some sort of triangular depression on the
    wall beside it.'
