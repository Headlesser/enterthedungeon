  description: 'You notice that part of the ceiling has caved in, blocking the path
    to the north. The pile of rubble is much too large to dig away by hand.

    There is an oddly shaped door to the east that is blocked by the same unidentified
    material as the main gate. There is some sort of <color=#008080ff>triangular depression</color>
    on the wall beside it.'
