  description: You feel the spray of salt water as you stand at the edge of an enormous
    gap too large to cross. An icy torrent of frothing water rushes below you. A fall
    down there would assuredly spell certain death. There is a raised drawbridge visible
    on the opposite ledge. A mechanism controlling the drawbridge sits near the ledge.
    It appears to be broken.
