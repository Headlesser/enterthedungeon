  - keyString: west
    exitDescription: To the WEST is a sturdy wooden door that appears slightly ajar.
      There are deep scratch marks near the lower left corner. The stones leading
      down the passageway appear stained with a dark, coagulated substance, and you
      can faintly make out what appears to be the decaying remains of torn fingernails.

  - keyString: east
    exitDescription: To the EAST is a rotting wooden door coated with a slimy residue
      that stinks of brine and mildew. You can feel a damp breeze flow from the passageway
      beyond. A low, steady rumble echoes just on the other side.
