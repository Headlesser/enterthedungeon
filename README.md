# EnterTheDungeon

These are the project files for my Enter The Dungeon project.

# Proposal

## Overall Idea

> What is your overall idea?

I want to make a text adventure game using the Unity game engine. I want to
accomplish at least a working, playable demo for the game by the end of March. 
I want to use this project to work on my puzzle design and writing skills
primarily. I will be following the [Unity training Text Adventure tutorial part 1](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/recorded-video-session-text-adventure-game-part-1#) and [part 2](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/recorded-video-session-text-adventure-game-part-2#) to create the basic framework for this project.

## Multimedia Tools

> What tool(s) do you hope to learn (or become more proficient at) over the course of this project?

Unity Engine, C#, Visual Studio Code

> How familiar are you with your chosen tools?

I have used Unity for around 2 years, but most of what I know has been self-taught
and I am not familiar with the tool to the extent that I am using it every day. I have
never created a 2D game in Unity before, and I have yet to dive into text-parsing
programming as opposed to OOP.

> How proficient do you expect to become via using your tools by the end of the semester?

Unity is quite a complex tool that has a lot of options that are out of scope for this
project. Thus, I will be mostly scratching the surface of Unity’s full capabilities, 
although I will be focused primarily on the 2D Sprite/Canvas options the engine
provides to display images/interact with text.

> What do you imagine your final project deliverable(s) will be based off the tool(s) you use to create it?

My final project deliverable will be a short demo (5~ minutes?) of a text adventure
game (in the form of a Unity executable). Its exact length is incredibly dependent on
time available. 

> Do you think your stated final deliverable(s) are fair?

Yes. Games are often over-scoped and this one is no different. I would be very glad
to get a working and polished 5 minute demo by then. I expect the project to likely
take more than 2 hours per week, so scoping down may be necessary.

## Target User Group
People who enjoy games, particularly young adults who
are familiar with and enjoy indie game culture. A more niche audience overall—
people who like text adventure games, but who desire a little more visual/auditory
stimulation than plain text.
